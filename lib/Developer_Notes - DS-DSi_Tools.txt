         Important Notes. Please Read Before Using The Tools!
===============================================================================

NOTE: For version 1.1 and beyond, Nintendo TWL is renamed Nintendo DSi.

This is a collection of important information concerning last-minute changes 
and other topics that deserve special attention. Please read these notes 
carefully, they supersede the manuals and other documentation.


*** THE PRODUCT LICENSE WILL EXPIRE MARCH 31, 2009 ***


IMPORTANT!

When this version of the IDE opens a project which was created
by previous versions of CW for Nintendo DS®, the IDE will perform a
project conversion to update to the current IDE.

You should not use the converted projects with older versions of CW for
Nintendo DS. The project files will be renamed with a suffix of "old.mcp"
before the conversion occurs. You may continue using the "old.mcp" project 
files in older versions of CW for Nintendo DS.

A warning is displayed before this project conversion occurs and the user can 
choose to cancel and prevent project conversion.

For example when opening a project named "SimpleProject.mcp", the IDE will 
convert the project and create a "SimpleProject.old.mcp" in the same location 
as SimpleProject.mcp.

===============================================================================
IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER and IS-TWL-DEBUGGER software
===============================================================================

All stationery and examples in this version use the libisdmainparm.a library
for debug output. You MUST install IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER and IS-TWL-DEBUGGER   
before installing CodeWarrior for DSi. It is also required to use the 
IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER/IS-TWL-DEBUGGER hardware from the CodeWarrior debugger. 
We recommend you install the latest IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER/IS-TWL-DEBUGGER
software available on the Nintendo site to prevent unexpected problems caused 
by a DLL conflict.

If you choose to install even though the IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER or IS-TWL-DEBUGGER 
is not installed, you must perform these steps to complete the CodeWarrior
installation:

1) Install a debugger, which will create the required environment variable.

   - DS:  Install IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER. Creates variable IS_NITRO_DIR.
   - DSi: Install IS-TWL-DEBUGGER. Creates variable IS_TWL_DEBUGGER_DIR.

2) Run this batch file in the CodeWarrior installation directory:
   
   {CW}\bin\setTWLSrcTree.bat
   
   This will ensure that your source trees are created correctly.

===============================================================================
Installing CodeWarrior for Nintendo DSi
===============================================================================

* HOW TO INSTALL
----------------
Run CW_NINTENDO_DSi_R1.1.exe to install this version.

See Known Issues below if you are installing on a system with Windows Vista.

* ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
-----------------------
The installer has been modified to attempt to detect an installation of the 
TWL SDK and Nitro SDK. It will look for the SDKs at these locations in this order:
    1. environment variable TWLSDK_ROOT for TWL and NITROSDK_ROOT for Nitro.
    2. environment variable IRISSDK_ROOT
    3. root of the C: drive, using the default folder names

In all cases, the installer will confirm the path found, or ask for a path, 
before continuing the installation. The installer will then create the 
environment variable CW_TWLSDK_ROOT for TWL and CW_NITROSDK_ROOT for Nitro to 
point to the selected path.

* SOURCE TREE CREATION
----------------------
The installer will ask the user to restart after completion. This allows it
to create source trees in CodeWarrior. The created source tree for TWL is 
{TWLSDK_ROOT} and it will point to the environment variable CW_TWLSDK_ROOT 
described above. The created source tree for Nitro is {NITROSDK_ROOT} and it 
will point to the environment variable CW_NITROSDK_ROOT described above.

NOTE: If the path used during installation does not point to a valid TWL SDK 
file structure or Nitro SDK file structure, the CodeWarrior projects will 
not build correctly. To correct this, make sure that the environment variables 
CW_TWLSDK_ROOT and CW_NITROSDK_ROOT are set to a valid path. (see Known Issues 
below if you are installing on Windows Vista)

* FAILURE HANDLING
------------------
If you get an error upon restarting your machine, the source tree creation has 
likely failed. The installation requires that the IDE be launched, and a 
failure is sometimes due to an unexpected IDE startup state. 

If a failure occurs, you can easily add the source tree by navigating to the 
{CW}\bin folder and running the setTWLSrcTree.bat batch file.

* SDK INTEROPERABILITY
----------------------------
If you install a new revision of the TWL SDK or the Nitro SDK, please remember 
to update the CodeWarrior environment variables, CW_TWLSDK_ROOT or 
CW_NITROSDK_ROOT, to point to the new location.

New Features
===============================================================================

- Support is now available to add the LTD Libraries to the LTDMAIN section. 
  This is shown with the TWL Hybrid stationery. In order to manually place the 
  LTD libraries in the LTDMAIN section, you will need to do the following:

   1. In the "Overlays" tab of your CodeWarrior project, right click to select 
      "Create Overlay Group...". The name "@LTDMAIN" should be entered for the 
      group. 
   
   2. Once the group has been created, double-click "@LTDMAIN", and enter the 
      "FF" as the "Base Code Address". 

      *  Please note that the "@LTDMAIN" group must be placed on a memory 
         address that is higher than the address of other shared overlay 
         groups. Please make sure that "@LTDMAIN" is located after standard 
         overlay groups.
   
   3. Expand the group "@LTDMAIN" and double-click "New Overlay" to rename the 
      overlay to "LTDMAIN".

   4. Drag your LTD libraries and other files into "LTDMAIN". The files can 
      also be added by right clicking "LTDMAIN" and selecting "Add Files...".

- A new prefix file called twl_TS_LTD_prefix.h has been added to 
  ARM_EABI_Support/TWL/prefix. It defines SDK_TWLLTD and should be used with 
  all LTD projects. It has been included in all new LTD stationeries.
  The existing file twl_TS_prefix.h remains to be used with all hybrid projects 
  since it defines SDK_TWLHYB. 
  
   *  Please note that the definition for SDK_RELEASE has been removed from
      twl_TS_prefix.h and is not included in twl_TS_LTD_prefix. This definition
      was removed to resolve conflicts that could occur when compiling ROM build
      targets. The removal of this definition may cause other projects to not
      build. To resolve the break, the proper SDK target definition should be 
      added to the C/C++ Preprocessor panel.

- This product was tested on the following operating systems:

   *  Microsoft® Windows XP® with SP3
   *  Microsoft Windows XP with SP2
   *  Microsoft Windows Vista® with SP1

Helpful Tips
===============================================================================

- Multiple Preferences/Workspaces - Normally, the preference settings for
  CodeWarrior installations are maintained globally here: 
  C:\Documents and Settings\(user name)\Local Settings\
    Application Data\Metrowerks

  It is recommended that the two files below, be copied into the same directory
  as "..\bin\IDE.exe" for all CodeWarrior installations:
	1. CodeWarrior IDE 5.9 Prefs...(IDE settings)
  	2. default-5.9.0.cww...........(default work space)

  This will allow you to associate each version of the CodeWarrior tools with
  its own settings.

- The DSi project stationery uses #define SDK_TS_VERSION 400 for X4 hardware 
  support. If you are using a different version of the hardware, be sure to
  update this define in Twl_TS.h to match your setup.

===============================================================================
Restrictions
===============================================================================

- Unavailable features
  Some features described in the IDE User's Guide are not available in this 
  product. The following list of features are not available or are not 
  supported:

  * Creating a new project from a makefile (Chapter 3 of the IDE User's Guide)
  * Creating a console application (Chapter 8 of the IDE User's Guide)
  * Flash Programmer (Chapter 22 of the IDE User's Guide)
  * Hardware Diagnostics tools (Chapter 22 of the IDE User's Guide)
  * Logic Analyzer (Chapter 22 of the IDE User's Guide)

- Source Tree creation 
  If during the installation of CodeWarrior, you specify a folder that does 
  not exist for an environment variable, then the source tree creation will
  fail. This sometimes occurs when a user does not install the SDKs and IS
  tools prior to installing CodeWarrior. It is recommended that you first 
  install the platform SDK and IS tools before installing CodeWarrior. 

- Limitations of the Makefile Exporter 
  The exporter creates a rudimentary makefile. The makefile needs to be 
  modified to work properly with the GNU make utility. The makefile that the 
  IDE generates contains text that will help you identify the corrections and 
  additions that you need to make. You must also add the build commands, 
  compiler switches, and options that you want the make utility to use.

  These limitations mean that the Makefile Exporter will tend to be more 
  successful exporting a makefile on simple CodeWarrior projects.

  To access the Makefile Exporter, use the Project menu and select Export 
  Project as Gnu makefile

- Limitation of the Expression Window
  When debugging variables of the same name across multiple scopes, 
  the expressions window sometimes does not correctly reflect all values of 
  the variables in each scope. 

- The environment variable, CW_MULTICORE_FOCUS_ONLY=TRUE, should not be 
  changed or removed. When debugging more than one device, it specifies that 
  the multicore menu applies only to the device whose debug session is 
  currently in focus.

- Debugger cannot step into FS_StartOverlay()
  You can set a breakpoint within the FS_StartOverlay() function but not on 
  line 508. Debugger cannot stop on breakpoint set on line 508 in 
  FS_StartOverlay().

- Debugging DSi EL relocatable modules
  To properly debug EL relocatable modules, it is necessary to build these 
  modules with the partial linking function of the linker (-partial option). 
  Building relocatable modules with the static library (-library option) will
  not allow the debugger to properly debug the file.

  There are two ways to allow the debugger to load the symbolic information for
  the EL relocatable modules and allow source level debugging to be available 
  when the elf file is dragged and dropped into the IDE. Ensure that the 
  partially linked files containing symbolic information are in either:
    * the same directory as the .tlf file
    * the search path for the project created by the drag and drop action

- DSi Watchpoint Limitations
  When a watchpoint is hit, the debugger may stop one or two instructions after
  the watchpoint hit occurred. This is due to a restriction in the hardware. 

  When two watchpoints are set, the watchpoint dialog will display the 
  message,"Watchpoint at address ?". Because of the hardware restriction, it 
  is not possible for the debugger to know which watchpoint has been hit.

===============================================================================
Known Issues
===============================================================================

- FB6033     If you open a source file that includes a character code that the
             IDE cannot convert into the Shift-JIS, such as wave dash U+301C, 
             the result in the editor will be garbled.

- MTWX28573  If the IDE Extras setting, "Used text-based projects", is turned
             off and you attempt to open a text-based project with the
             workspace or from the file menu, you may see the error message,
             "Resource File Error 207008. Unable to open project..." To view
             the contents of the text-based project you can drag and drop the
            .mcp file into the IDE.

- MTWX30362  When using the memory view and stepping, sometimes the view will 
             refresh and position itself to an incorrect address. To restore 
             the previous position, click in the "Display" field and press 
             Enter. 

- MTWX31311  The output strings by OS_Printf()/OS_TPrintf() may be broken when 
             a large number of strings are output continuously.

- When installing under Windows Vista, the installer creates environment 
  variables that point to the SDK directories. Sometimes the 
  installer does not create the environment variable correctly. You can see 
  and modify the environmental variables in the CodeWarrior Source Trees 
  settings panel.

  To see if the environmental variables have been defined correctly:
  1. Open the CodeWarrior IDE
  2. Select Edit > Preferences, then select Source Trees (listed under General) 
  3. Make sure that TWLSDK_ROOT, CW_TWLSDK_ROOT, NITROSDK_ROOT,
     CW_NITROSDK_ROOT are defined to point to the root of your SDK
     installations and IS_TWL_DEBUGGER_DIR and IS_NITRO_DIR, are defined to 
     point to the IS_TWL_DEBUGGER and IS-NITRO-Debugger installation
     directories.

     If the installer did not define the TWL paths correctly, do the following:
	 a. Type TWLSDK_ROOT in Source Tree Information section's Name field
	 b. Select Absolute Path in the Type field
	 c. Press Choose to browse to and select root directory of TWL SDK
	 d. Click Add button
         e. Repeat steps a through d to add IS_TWL_DEBUGGER_DIR and 
            CW_TWLSDK_ROOT
	 f. Click Apply button; Click OK button to close panel

     If the installer did not define the Nitro paths correctly, do the 
     following:
	 a. Type NITROSDK_ROOT in Source Tree Information section’s Name field
	 b. Select Absolute Path in the Type field
	 c. Press Choose to browse to and select root directory of Nitro SDK
	 d. Click Add button
	 e. Repeat steps a through d to add IS_NITRO_DIR and CW_NITROSDK_ROOT
	 f. Click Apply button; Click OK button to close panel

- Make sure the path to the Ensata emulator is valid in this file:
	{CW}\bin\\plugins\support\Nitro\IS\est_cw_debugger.ini
  Otherwise, when you try to debug, you will get an error message stating that 
  you should update the file. If you close the IDE after seeing this alert,
  IDE may crash.

- .bin files in a directory with Japanese characters are not loading
  correctly.

- Remote Connections in some cases may not show up. If this occurs, edit the
  file and remove the "global" remote connection.

- If you use the DS Profiling feature to display profiling data for your 
  project, you may notice that a Trace menu item becomes available on the Data
  menu. The Trace window can be displayed by selecting it, but it will not
  display meaningful data since the Trace feature is unimplemented at this
  time.
